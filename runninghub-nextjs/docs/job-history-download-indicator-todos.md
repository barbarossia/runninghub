# Job History Download Indicator TODOs

- [x] Review existing Job History UI in `runninghub-nextjs/src/components/workspace/JobList.tsx`.

- [x] Pass `jobId` + `jobOutputPath` from Job History preview save and Job Detail save actions.
- [x] Add `hasSavedMediaOutputs` helper and render a "Saved" badge.
- [ ] Sanity check the Job History list layout for completed and failed jobs.
